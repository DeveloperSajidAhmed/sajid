    <div class="margin">
        <p class="justify">"This is the wisdom which the higer spiriture powers have forworded to me throught my ability
            to perceive the invisible. Hopefully, they will continue to do so, provided I don't make any serious
            mistakes. I have gained the ability, mentioned above, through a lot of suffering that on several occasions,
            has taken me to the "other side. But my stubbom wish to look for hidden positivity in the most negative
            sutuation along with my desire to seek out the reasons for each negativity has never failed to bring me back
            from death's door. I have always wanted to be able to see and spiritual light was guided in my life. Before,
            I used to be blind, thinking myself to be sighted. I had to go throught a lot of senseless suffering for
            that."</p>
